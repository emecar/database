
foreign key column must be unique entity with a relationship that must be non-nullable,

For a one-to-one relationship, we can choose which table should have the foreign key column.
Regardless of which table we choose, the column values must be unique. 

when we have tables in one-to-many relationships, the table representing the "many" side will hold the foreign key columns.

-- one to many
==============
CREATE TABLE events (
    id SERIAL,
    show_time TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    auditorium_id INT,
    film_id INT NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE events
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_events_auditoria
FOREIGN KEY (auditorium_id)
REFERENCES auditoria;

ALTER TABLE events
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_events_films
FOREIGN KEY (film_id)
REFERENCES films;
==============
-- One to one
==============

CREATE TABLE accounts (
   id SERIAL,
   username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
   password TEXT NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id),
   customer_id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);


ALTER TABLE accounts
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_accounts_customers
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
REFERENCES customers;

==============
many to many
=============

CREATE TABLE customers_events (
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    event_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, event_id)
);



Question - doews the one-to-one relationship have to apply a UNIQUE constraint on the column with the foreign key
